Hello, I'm Brian Ciepichal and I am a third year student at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Information Technology. 
My professional development experience starting with working at London Computer Systems as a Quality Assurance Software Tester.
Therefore, even though I was not doing development I still worked closely with many developers and learned many new things. 	
 Also in my professional career I have spent some time as a developer. I used the experience I gained as a QA Tester to
aid in creating automation tools for testing various software.
I have many hobbies and a lot of them involve computers. Those specific hobbies are: programming, gaming, and viewing media. 
Outside of computers I enjoy many physical activities, my favorite of those being running. I am looking forward to this semester
to expand my development knowledge and be able to better apply javascript to any website I end up working on.
